# Angular 1 Form.io Builder and Angular 2 Form Renderer

This repository holds the Two Clinet side projects 
 - builder
 - ng2Forms (renders the forms created by above builder)
 
 you can access builder by just accessing http://localhost:3333/builder if loopback application is running.
 
 to access angular 2 form rendering app `ng2Forms` open the terminal in ng2Forms directory and run the following commands
 
	- `npm install`
    - `npm start` 
	
 it will open the app on http://localhost:3000
 (ideally this should run on http://localhost:3333/ng2Forms but i am not successfull in it till now)
